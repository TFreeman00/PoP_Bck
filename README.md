Photography site for my real estate photography company

Backend (Server-side):

Node.js and Express:

Set up your server using Node.js and Express framework to handle API requests and user interactions.
Define routes for functionalities like:
User authentication (optional, for managing bookings)
Booking appointments (using a POST request with date and time)
Uploading photos (using a POST request with image data)
Retrieving photos based on property ID or booking ID (using a GET request)
Contact form submission (using a POST request with form data)
Prisma and MySQL:

Use Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with your MySQL database.
Define data models for:
Users (if implementing authentication)
Bookings (stores date, time, property details)
Properties (optional, if storing property information)
Photos (stores image URL, property ID, booking ID)
Implement Prisma CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data in your database.
Google API Integration:

Use the Google Calendar API to integrate appointment scheduling.
Implement functionality to:
Create calendar events upon booking confirmation (storing booking details)
Update or delete events based on booking changes
Email Integration:

Use a Node.js email library (like Nodemailer) to connect with your business email.
Implement functionality on the contact form submission route to send emails with contact information to your business email address.
Frontend (Client-side):

Choose a Frontend Framework (Optional):

Consider using a framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular for a more structured and interactive user interface.
If you prefer simpler HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that's also an option.
User Interface Design:

Design your website with sections for:
Portfolio showcasing your real estate photography work
Booking form with calendar integration (using a calendar library)
Contact form with input fields for name, email, message
About me/Services section
API Calls:

Develop functionalities using JavaScript (or framework libraries) to make API calls to your backend server for:
Booking appointments (sending data to the booking route)
Uploading photos (using form data and file upload functionality)
Contact form submission (sending data to the contact form route)
Additional Considerations:

Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on the backend to secure your API routes and user data.
Image Storage: While Google Drive can be used for temporary storage during upload, consider a dedicated image storage service for long-term photo management.
Deployment: Choose a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS to deploy your server-side application.
